# About

I'm Guðmundur Hjalmar Egilsson and this is my homepage. Here I might share stuff I find interesting.

You can also view my CV [here](/cv). When I'm not at work, where I work with software development for autonomous trucks, I enjoy being out. Either on my bike, running, hiking, and/or with friends. When not outside, I follow the world of pro-cycling fanatically, try to do some programming or work on other projects, and try to keep my bike(s) in a working state.
